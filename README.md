# Quantum Grover Algorithm Implementation

## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Grover's Algorithm**, a quantum algorithm designed to search an unsorted database or solve unstructured problems faster than any classical algorithm. The implementation uses the Qiskit library for quantum computing and involves:

- Initializing a quantum circuit.
- Applying Grover's Oracle and Diffuser gates.
- Measuring the results and iteratively refining the solution.

## How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-link>
```

### 2. Install Required Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following packages:

- Qiskit
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- pylatexenc (optional for LaTeX support in circuit diagrams)

Install the dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install qiskit matplotlib numpy pylatexenc
```

### 3. Run the Notebook
Open the notebook in Jupyter or any IDE supporting Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially to:

1. Initialize the quantum circuit.
2. Define the oracle and diffuser functions.
3. Run the Grover's algorithm and visualize the results.

## Features

- **Quantum Circuit Initialization:** Prepares the quantum register and applies Hadamard gates to create a superposition.
- **Grover Oracle:** Encodes the problem to mark the correct solution state.
- **Diffuser Gate:** Amplifies the probability of the correct state using quantum interference.
- **Simulation:** Uses Qiskit Aer to simulate the quantum circuit and measure results.
- **Iterative Improvement:** Adjusts the oracle based on prior measurements for enhanced accuracy.

## Dependencies

- `qiskit`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `pylatexenc` (optional)

Install these with:
```bash
pip install qiskit numpy matplotlib pylatexenc
```

## Running the Notebook

1. Ensure your Python environment has all required libraries installed.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred IDE.
3. Execute the cells sequentially.
4. Observe the quantum circuit visualizations and the measurement results.

## Output
